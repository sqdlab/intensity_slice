    An interactive Cursor for matplotlib plots in a wxwidgets application,

    Each line can independently be picked and moved using the mouse,
    by pressing the left mouse button near one of the lines, and moving
    the mouse while keeping the button pressed. The Cursor is released 
    by releasing the mouse button.
    
    If the left button is pressed near the crossing of both Cursor lines, 
    both lines are picked and can be moved simultaneously.
    
    When the mouse is in a pickable position, the mouse cursor changes its icon,

    # The locking applies even before the user pressed the left mouse button.

    # cursor by approaching the location along a path that favours that particular

    # established, the mouse cursor is already set and movement parameter is
